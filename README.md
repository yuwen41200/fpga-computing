Research Project on FPGA Parallel Heterogeneous Computing

This is a subproject of [sunset1995/Leilei_Face-tracking_Algorithm](https://github.com/sunset1995/Leilei_Face-tracking_Algorithm).

## Information ##

The targeted board is Xilinx Virtex-5 ML506.  
The host program runs on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS.

This project uses an Xillybus IP core for data transmission over an PCIe interface.  
One can download it for free from [xillybus.com](http://xillybus.com/) for academic purposes.

The RTL design is done with Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7.
